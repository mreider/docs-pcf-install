<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director for VMWare vCloud Air and vCloud.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in the [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; on vSphere and vCloud Air](vsphere.html) and [Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud](pcf-vchs-vcloud.html) topics. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and vCloud](config-er-vmware.html) topic.

## <a id='vcloud-config'></a>Step 1: vCloud Config Page

1. Log in to Ops Manager and click the **Ops Manager Director** tile.

    <%= image_tag("vcair-tile.png") %>

1. Select **vCloud Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vcloud-configuration.png") %>

1. Enter the following information.
    * **vCloud API URL**: The URL of the vCloud Director.
    * **Organization name**: The name of your organization.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: vCloud Air and vCloud Director use case-sensitive organization names. The name that you supply in the Ops Manager <strong>Organization name</strong> field must match the vCD organization name exactly.</p>
    * **Username**: The username for a user who has create and delete privileges for virtual machines (VMs) and folders.
    * **Password**: The password for the user provided in the previous step.
    * **Virtual Datacenter name**. The name of the virtual datacenter as it appears in vCloud Director. The name is an alphanumeric string with a `VDC` prefix. For example, `VDC-M903513742-9043`.
    * **Storage Profile name**: The name of the storage profile as it appears in vCloud Director.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='dir-config'></a>Step 2: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.
    <%= image_tag("vcloud-director-config.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.
1. If you have installed and configured the JMX Bridge product, enter your **Metrics IP Address**.
1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable Ops Manager Resurrector functionality and increase Elastic Runtime availability. For more information, see the [Using Ops Manager Resurrector on VMware vSphere](./resurrector.html) topic.
1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.
1. Select **HM Pager Duty Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with PagerDuty.
    * **Service Key**: Enter your API service key from PagerDuty.
    * **HTTP Proxy**: Enter an HTTP proxy for use with PagerDuty.
1. Select **HM Email Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with email.
    * **Host**: Enter your email hostname.
    * **Port**: Enter your email port number.
    * **Domain**: Enter your domain.
    * **From**: Enter the address for the sender.
    * **Recipients**: Enter comma-separated addresses of intended recipients.
    * **Username**: Enter the username for your email server.
    * **Password**: Enter the password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security.
1. For **Blobstore Location**, Pivotal recommends that you select **Internal**. However, if you select **S3 Compatible Blobstore**, complete the **S3 Endpoint**, **Bucket Name**, **Access Key**, **Secret Key**, **V2 Signature/V4 Signature**, and **Region** with information from your blobstore provider.
1. By default, Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) deploys and manages an **Internal** database for you. If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.
1. **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager Director can run simultaneously. For vCloud, the default value is `4`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.
1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After your initial deployment, you will not be able to edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 3: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.
    <%= image_tag("vcloud-create-networks.png") %>
1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    * Enter the **vCloud Network Name** as it appears in vCloud Director.
    * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `10.9.9.0/24`.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR** that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any IP in this range.
    * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='assign-networks'></a>Step 4: Assign Networks Page

1. Select **Assign Networks**.
<%= image_tag("vcloud-assign-networks.png") %>
1. Use the drop-down menu to select the network that acts as the infrastructure and deployment network for Ops Manager. You can configure the Ops Manager Director to have an IP address on one network.
    
## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 5: Security Page

1. Select **Security**.

    <%= image_tag("vcloud-om-security.png") %>

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate. If you want to use Docker Trusted Registries for running app instances in Docker containers, use this field to enter your certificate for your private Docker Trusted Registry. See the [Using Docker Trusted Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic for more information.
1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.
1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 6: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.
<%= image_tag("vcloud-resources.png") %>
1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment, such as increasing the persistent disk size. Select **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to provision the amount of persistent disk predefined by the job. If the persistent disk field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p> 
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete-installation'></a>Step 7: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click **Apply Changes**.
1. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and vCloud](config-er-vmware.html) topic.
