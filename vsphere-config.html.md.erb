    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder (default: `pcf_disk`) where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. You must not nest this folder.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After your initial deployment, you will not be able to edit the VM Folder, Template Folder, and Disk path Folder names.</p>

## <a id='dir-config'></a>Step 2: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("director-config.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.
1. If you have installed and configured the JMX Bridge product, enter your **Metrics IP Address**.
1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable Ops Manager Resurrector functionality and increase Elastic Runtime availability. For more information, see the [Using Ops Manager Resurrector on VMware vSphere](./resurrector.html) topic.
1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.
1. Select **HM Pager Duty Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with PagerDuty.
    * **Service Key**: Enter your API service key from PagerDuty.
    * **HTTP Proxy**: Enter an HTTP proxy for use with PagerDuty.
1. Select **HM Email Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with email.
    * **Host**: Enter your email hostname.
    * **Port**: Enter your email port number.

    * **From**: Enter the address for the sender.
    * **Recipients**: Enter comma-separated addresses of intended recipients.
    * **Username**: Enter the username for your email server.
    * **Password**: Enter the password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security.
1. For **Blobstore Location**, Pivotal recommends that you select **Internal**. However, if you select **S3 Compatible Blobstore**, complete the **S3 Endpoint**, **Bucket Name**, **Access Key**, **Secret Key**, **V2 Signature/V4 Signature**, and **Region** with information from your blobstore provider.
1. By default, Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) deploys and manages an **Internal** database for you. If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.
1. **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is `32`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.
1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After your initial deployment, you will not be able to edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>

## <a id='create-az'></a>Step 3: Create Availability Zone Page
Ops Manager Availability Zones correspond to your vCenter clusters and resource pools. Multiple Availability Zones allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the Availability Zones assigned to the application.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.
<%= image_tag("create-az.png") %>
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your applications to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the Availability Zone.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an Availability Zone.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 4: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.
<%= image_tag("create-network.png") %>
1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `DIRECTORY-NAME/NETWORK-NAME`.
    * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `10.9.9.0/24`.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any IP in this range.
    * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.
1. Click **Save**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Multiple networks allow you to place vCenter on a private network and the rest of your deployment on a public network. Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Cisco Nexus
      1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco
      Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.
    </p>

## <a id='assign-azs'></a>Step 5: Assign AZs and Networks Page

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.
<%= image_tag("assign-az.png") %>
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Network** for your Ops Manager Director.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 6: Security Page

1. Select **Security**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere-om-security.png") %>

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate. If you want to use Docker Trusted Registries for running app instances in Docker containers, use this field to enter your certificate for your private Docker Trusted Registry. See the [Using Docker Trusted Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic for more information.
1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.
1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 7: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere-om-resources.png") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p> 

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete-installation'></a>Step 8: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click **Apply Changes** on the right navigation. 
1. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and vCloud](config-er-vmware.html) topic.
