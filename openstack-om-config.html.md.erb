<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director after deploying
[Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack.
Use this topic when [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; on OpenStack](./openstack.html).

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all
steps in the [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html)
topic.
After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Installing Elastic Runtime after Deploying PCF on OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html)
topic.

## <a id='log-in'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager 1.7 security features require that you log in using a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager.</a></p> 

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain you created in the [Create a DNS Entry](./openstack-setup.html#dns-entry) step of [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html).

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

1.  Log in to your identity provider and use the information below to configure SAML Service Provider Properties:
    * Service Provider Entity ID: opsman-login
    * ACS URL : https:<span>//<span>OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/uaa/saml/SSO/alias/opsman-login
    * Binding : HTTP Post
    * SLO URL: https:<span>//<span/>OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/uaa/saml/SingleLogout/alias/opsman-login
    * Binding : HTTP Redirect
    * Name ID : Email Address

1. When redirected to the **Use an Identity Provider** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Retrieve the metadata URL from your Identity Provider and copy it into the **Use an Identity Provider** area.
    * Create a passphrase. Ops Manager encrypts data using the passphrase that you provide.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("meta-url.png") %>

1. Enter a **Username** and a **Password**.

1. Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept.

### <a id='internal'></a>Use Internal Authentication ###

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **Http proxy** or **Https proxy**, enter the proxy URL. If specified, Ops Manager will redirect traffic to a designated proxy server. If there are addresses that should not be used to access the proxy, enter them in the **No proxy** field. Pivotal recommends listing the Bosh Director IP address in the **No proxy field.** To find the Bosh Director IP, review the [Create Network](#create-networks) section below, and consider the **Reserved IP Ranges**. The Bosh Director IP is the first IP after the range. For example, if you enter `10.0.16.0-10.0.16.10` in the **Reserved IP Ranges** field, the Bosh Director IP will be `10.0.16.11`.     
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

## <a id='openstack-config'></a>Step 2: Complete the OpenStack Config Page ##

1. In the left navigation of your OpenStack dashboard, click **Project > Compute > Access & Security**. Select the **API Access** tab.

1. Record the **Service Endpoint** for the **Identity** service.
You use this Service Endpoint as the Authentication URL for Ops Manager in a
later step.

## <a id='security'></a>Step 8: Complete the Security Page ##

1. Select **Security**.
    <%= image_tag("openstack/om-security.png") %>

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate. If you want to use Docker Trusted Registries for running app instances in Docker containers, use this field to enter your certificate for your private Docker Trusted Registry. See the [Using Docker Trusted Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic for more information.
1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.
1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment, such as increasing the persistent disk size. Select **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to provision the amount of persistent disk predefined by the job. If the persistent disk field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p> 

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete-ops'></a>Step 10: Complete Ops Manager Director Installation ##

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, click
**Ignore errors and start the install**.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/icmp-error.png") %>

1. Ops Manager Director installs. The image shows the **Changes Applied** message that Ops Manager displays when the installation process successfully completes.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/om-installed.png") %>

1. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Installing Elastic Runtime after Deploying PCF on OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html) topic.
