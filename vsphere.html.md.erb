This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on vSphere and vCloud Air.
It walks you through deploying the installation virtual machine known as Ops Manager, configuring your vSphere settings, and installing PCF Elastic Runtime.

If you experience a problem while following the steps below, refer to the [Known Issues](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) topics or to the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.html).
Once you have completed the steps in this guide, explore the documentation on
[docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io) to learn more about [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF)
and the Pivotal product suite.

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you are performing an upgrade from PCF 1.6 to 1.7, see <a href="upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Ops Manager</a> for critical upgrade information.</p>

## <a id='system'></a>Step 1: Confirm System Requirements ##

Before you begin your PCF deployment, ensure that your system meets the
minimum requirements.
The requirements include capacity for the virtual machines necessary for the
deployment, a supported version of the cf Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool, 
and certain user privileges.
Refer to the [Prerequisites to Deploying Operations Manager and Elastic Runtime](./requirements.html) topic for the complete list.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Step 2: Deploy PCF Ops Manager ##

1. Log in to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and download the Ops
Manager virtual appliance file that matches your infrastructure.

1. Deploy Ops Manager using the procedure that corresponds to the VMware environment that you use:
   * <a href="./deploying-vm.html" class="subnav">Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere</a>
   * <a href="./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html" class="subnav">Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud</a>

If you deploy Ops Manager to vSphere, review the topic about <a href="./disk-format.html" class="subnav">Provisioning a Virtual Disk in vSphere</a>. 

## <a id='paas'></a>Step 3: Configure and Install PCF ##

**Goal**: Configure and install Ops Manager Director (included), Elastic
Runtime, and MySQL for PCF.
Skip the import steps for Elastic Runtime or MySQL for PCF if you do not
want to import these products.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager 1.7 security features require that you log in using a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager.</a></p> 

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.

1. The first time you start Ops Manager, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

<%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

1.  Log in to your identity provider and use the information below to configure SAML Service Provider Properties:
    * Service Provider Entity ID: opsman-login
    * ACS URL : https:<span>//<span>OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/uaa/saml/SSO/alias/opsman-login
    * Binding : HTTP Post
    * SLO URL: https:<span>//<span/>OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/uaa/saml/SingleLogout/alias/opsman-login
    * Binding : HTTP Redirect
    * Name ID : Email Address

1. If you choose to proceed to the **Use an Identity Provider** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Retrieve the metadata URL from your Identity Provider, and copy and paste it into the **Use an Identity Provider** area.
    * Create a passphrase. Ops Manager encrypts data using the passphrase that you provide.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("meta-url.png") %>

1.  Enter your username and password when your Identity Provider login page appears. Click **Login**.

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **Http proxy** or **Https proxy**, enter the proxy URL. If specified, Ops Manager will redirect traffic to a designated proxy server. If there are addresses that should not be used to access the proxy, enter them in the **No proxy** field. Pivotal recommends listing the Bosh Director IP address in the **No proxy field.** To find the Bosh Director IP, review the [vSphere Create Network](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#create-networks) or [vCloud Create Network](../customizing/vchs-vcloud-config.html) topics, and consider the **Reserved IP Ranges**. The Bosh Director IP is the first IP after the range. For example, if you enter `10.0.16.0-10.0.16.10` in the **Reserved IP Ranges** field, the Bosh Director IP will be `10.0.16.11`.  
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On your first login attempt, an error message that the connection is untrusted appears because you are attempting to connect securely to a website with a self-signed certificate. Add Ops Manager as an exception to bypass this message on subsequent logins. </p>
