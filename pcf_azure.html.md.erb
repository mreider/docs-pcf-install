This topic describes how to deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) on Microsoft Azure. This deployment is suitable for proof-of-concept or trial workloads, not for production.

PCF on Microsoft Azure is available as an offering in [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/pivotal/pivotal-cloud-foundryazure-pcf/). The Azure Marketplace offering installs a pre-configured deployment of PCF and key PCF services. No upgrade path is available for this offering to a production deployment.

##<a id='components'></a>Components ##

PCF on Microsoft Azure includes the following components:

* [Elastic Runtime](../installing/pcf-docs.html)
* [RabbitMQ for PCF](../../rabbitmq-cf/index.html)
* [MySQL for PCF](../../p-mysql/index.html)
* [Redis for PCF](../../redis/)
* [Spring Cloud Services for PCF](../../spring-cloud-services/)

##<a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites##

You must have the following in order to use PCF on Microsoft Azure:

* A pay-as-you-go subscription on your Azure account.

* A Pivotal Network account: If you do not already have an account, [create one](https://network.pivotal.io/). Retrieve the API token for your profile by performing the following steps:
    1. Sign into the Pivotal Network.
    1. Navigate to your name in the top right and click **Edit Profile**. 
    1. Record the API token located at the bottom of the page.

* An Azure command line tool on your machine. 
    * For Linux/Unix/Mac OS X, follow these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/) to install the Azure CLI. Then use this [shell script](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/bosh-azure-template/blob/master/create_azure_principal.sh) to create an Azure Service Principal. Record the `TENANT-ID`, `CLIENT-ID`, `CLIENT-SECRET` produced by the script.
    * For Windows, follow these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/powershell-install-configure/) to install the Azure PowerShell. Then use this [PowerShell script](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/bosh-azure-template/blob/master/create_azure_principal_powershell.txt) to create an Azure Service Principal. Record the `TENANT-ID`, `CLIENT-ID`, `CLIENT-SECRET` produced by the script.

* Sufficient resources for your Azure account. PCF on Azure allocates the following resources during deployment:
  * 53 VMs: The deployment uses a total of 53 VMs during the installation. 
15 VMs are created to run jobs and errands and are subsequently destroyed. 38 VMs continue to run after installation. 
  * 1 storage account
  * 3 public IPs
  * 1 jumpbox VM that runs the deployment using [BOSH](http://bosh.io/)

    For more information, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-subscription-service-limits/). To raise your quota, follow the instructions in <a href="#raising-quota">Raise Your Quota</a> below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The tile deployment progress shows completed when the initial jumpbox VM is provisioned. 
This does not indicate the deployment is complete.</p>

##<a id='verify'></a>Verify the PCF on Microsoft Azure Installation ##

1. From your Azure Portal, navigate to **Resource Groups** and ensure the new **Resource Group** has been created.
	<%= image_tag("azure/resource_group.png") %>

2. SSH into the jumpbox VM by performing the following steps:
	1. Navigate to **Resource groups** > **cf** > **Deployment history** and select your deployment.
	1. Under the **Outputs** section, record the **JUMPBOX-FQDN**. This is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the jumpbox VM.
	1. Use a SSH client to open an SSH connection to the jumpbox VM, with the username `pivotal`. <br>
          * Linux/Unix/Mac OS X: For example, run the command `$ ssh pivotal@myjumpboxujnk2hiwzqq3y.westus.cloudapp.azure.com`.
          * Windows: For example, use PuTTY to SSH into the jumpbox VM. Locate your public key file and paste the contents into the appropriate text field in PuTTY.

    <%= image_tag("azure/jumpbox.png") %>

3. View the PCF deployment log on the jumpbox VM at <code>/home/pivotal/pcf\_install.log</code>.

4. Find the Apps Manager URL and the admin password:

  1. In the Azure Portal, return to the **Outputs** section of your deployment. 
  2. Navigate to the URL shown in **PROGRESSMONITORURL** textbox. This is the URL to a tmux session in which you find the Apps Manager URL and admin password that 
you use to log in to the Apps Manager console:
 <pre class="terminal">
   print "============================================================"
   print "Apps Manager URL : {0}".format(apps\_manager\_address)
   print "Admin password   : {0}".format(admin\_password)
   print "Documentation    : <span>http:</span>//docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/pcf-docs.html"
   print "============================================================"
 </pre>
 If the URL not longer shows the tmux session, see [Cannot find the admin password or Apps Manager URL](#cantfindpsswd) below.

6. From your Azure Portal, navigate to **Resources** and find the **Public IP address** resource named <code>YOUR-JUMPBOX-NAME–cf</code> and select it. 
	<%= image_tag("azure/app_manager_one.png") %>
7. Record the **IP address**. This is the IP address of Apps Manager.
	<%= image_tag("azure/app_manager_two.png") %>
8. Navigate to the URL `https://apps.system.APPS-MANAGER-IP-ADDRESS.cf.pcfazure.com`, and log in to Apps Manager with the username `admin` and the password obtained above. 

9. From Apps Manager, verify that your services are running.

##<a id='troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting ##

* [Deployment fails](#deployfails)
* [Cannot find the admin password or Apps Manager URL](#cantfindpsswd)

###<a id='deployfails'></a>Deployment fails

**Symptom:** PCF on Azure fails to deploy. 

**Solution**: If the deployment fails after the jumpbox VM has been created, capture the PCF deployment log as described in the [verification procedure above](#verify) and send it to azure-inquiry@pivotal.io with any additional information about the installation that you can provide. 

###<a id='cantfindpsswd'></a>Cannot Find the Admin Password or Apps Manager URL

**Symptom**: The URL in the PROGRESSMONITORURL field no longer takes you to the tmux session to locate the Apps Manager URL and admin password.

**Solution**: Even though the tmux session has been lost, you can retrieve the Apps Manager URL and admin password by searching for `admin` in the `manifests/elastic-runtime.yml` file on the jumpbox VM:
 <pre class="terminal">
$ cat manifests/elastic-runtime.yml | grep admin
  admin\_user: admin
  admin\_password: "0a0d3a14b6520ea2bf7b"
 </pre>
